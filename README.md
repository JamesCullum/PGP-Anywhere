# PGP Anywhere

~[Chrome Webstore]~ / [Edge Webstore]

Encrypt and decrypt PGP wherever you are!

The plugin is temporarily not available on the Chrome Webstore due to [@lonesomewalker](https://github.com/lonesomewalker) impersonating the author of the plugin and filing a falsified DMCA report. A counter report has been opened and approved, but Google wasn't successful in restoring the plugin so far.
